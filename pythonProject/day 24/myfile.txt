Jaipur is the capital city and heart of Rajasthan. We host thousands of tourists every year. For them Jaipur starts at  Amer fort and ends at Hawa mahal. If you ask me Jaipur is much more than these places. Real Jaipur lies in terracotta pottery, silver and lac jewelleries, Kota dories sarees, lehariya dupattas and bandhani sarees. Real Jaipur lies in markets of Chandpole and Johari bazaar. The pink textures when you pass through these markets at night time makes it worth more than thousand Europe trips. Jaipur generally is too hot in summers and too cold in winters. My favourite season is rain which brings balance to this city. Jaipur rains are worth the watch. After scorching heats of summer they fall like glitters in the city giving a sense of calmness and coolness to the city. They add a sense of purpose and life to this cityâ€™s people.
